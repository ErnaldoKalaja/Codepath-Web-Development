## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I did not encounter any challenges in creating this submission.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How to implement more than one tab into your webpage. How to have a menu with slection. How to display links into other tabs through images. How to store user data to 
display to them in a presentable way. How to implement videos into your webpage.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would have liked to maybe add more minigames / puzzle games into the webpage. Have the user open up a menu on the top left where they can select from a number of games.
Have a central terminal tab when they open up the webpage. Add a scoreboard where you can see how well other players did. Add little guide videos that explain how the games work.
Modify the design so that each game's tab has its own fitting coloration and such, include images to it.
